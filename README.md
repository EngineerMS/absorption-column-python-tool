# Absorption Packed Column Design Tool

This Python tool helps chemical and process engineers design an absorption packed column using structured packing. 

It includes:

âœ… Material and equilibrium balances  
âœ… Fixed gas velocity sizing  
âœ… NTU and packed height calculation  
âœ… Structured packing sizing  
âœ… Packing diameter recommendation  
âœ… Pressure drop profile  
âœ… Solvent cost analysis  
âœ… Visual plots for operating and equilibrium lines

### ðŸ“ˆ How to Use

1. Update flow rates, Henry's constant, or physical properties if needed.
2. Run the script in a Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Review the output and plots for engineering decisions.
